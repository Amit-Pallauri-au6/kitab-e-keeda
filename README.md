    Books are one of the most important things for a human being to survive with knowledge and wisdom. We all love to read books. Or at least some of us do. And as a reader myself, I don’t want to just pick anything from the store without knowing anything about it. It would be a loss of money and the guilt of leaving the book unread because it’s less interesting.So we have built an web application with the help of which, a user can see all the reviews and ratings of a particular book has gotten from other users who have already read the book and given their valuable reviews there. We have also implemented a feature where the user can follow other users and the followed user can post some stories about any book they like, or any recommendation or any thoughts on the books he/she have already read. And the follower users can like/dislike their posts and add/update/delete comments as well as make threads under those comments also

## Technologies used:-

    nodejs - For backend,
    Express js - backend framework
    MongoDB - primary database
    Mongoose - ORM for mongoDB   

## Npm packages

    Nodemon to keep the server running
    jsonWebToken to create a token based authentication
    bcryptjs to hash the password
    datauri to convert the buffered data from the uploaded file to a readable stream data
    dotenv to store the passwords and secret keys
    uuid to generate random ids to use in authentication
    Nodemailer for verifying mail
    Multer for uploading files
    Cloudinary for saving the uploaded files in cloud storage
    Mongoose Object relational mapping for all mongodb database functionality

## Future Scope:-

   > As the web app is totally based on backend, we will be adding front end in near future so that it would look much interactive and neat

    We will be using features like, signing up with google, facebook with passportjs
    We will be adding razorpay so that the user would buy the books from our own site also.
